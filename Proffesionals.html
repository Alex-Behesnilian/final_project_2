    <h1>Top 10 Proffesional players</h1>
    <h3> 1 to 5 </h3>
    <p>The game is very competitive. It would not make sense to have a game this
    competitive and not have a proffesional scene. There are many professionals, but I
  will be listing only the top 10 players in my opinion as the best players can be
a debateable topic. The first player is from North America being Cloud 9's very own Shroud.
Shroud is a young player who has incredible aim with any weapon you give him. In second there is
a European player Scream. Scream is known for being very good at hitting one taps(One shot head shot kills).
Third is European player KennyS. He is the worlds best awper, known for making plays with the awp.
Fourth is North America's Hiko. Hiko is a very strong player who will clutch very important rounds,
known to win 1 vs 5 rounds, And fifth is Get_Right. Get_Right is a European player who is the clutch king
competing with hiko for this top spot as clutch king.</p>
<h3>6 to 10</h3>
<p>The next list contains the rest of my top players. The order they are listed is not the order of preference.
First is a player from the team HellRaisers, Niko. Niko is known for his increadible
deagle play. Second is Stewie2k. Stewie is very well known for running around and even through
smokes to catch his enemies off guard. Third is a young European hot shot, S1mple. S1mple
is known for playing CSGO at a more advanced level than even pro's can. Fourth is Olofmeister. Olof
is very well known for being the previous champion of CSGO with the team Fnatic. He is exceptional with any weapon he uses.
Finally there is Swag. Swag is a member of the banned players of IBuyPower. They were all banned
on account of match fixing. Although he is banned from tournaments he still stands as the worlds
smartest player to me.
This list was not in order of any sort but was created to name my top 10 players.</p>
