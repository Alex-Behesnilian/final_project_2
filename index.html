    <h1>Counter-Strike!</h1>
    <h3>Counter-Strike Gameplay</h3>
    <p>Counter-Strike is a huge multiplayer game that has spread across the world through
    a platform called steam. This game began as a mod for the game Half-Life.
  It later became it's own game and later series. The game is a 5 vs 5 team based game.
One team acts as terrorist trying to blow up a bomb site while the other team is trying to stop the bomb from exploding.
It begins in a pistol round, where both teams have very little money to spend in order to buy utility, nades, or weapons.
The winning team of the first round will usually move on to gain a larger economy, allowing them to buy more and better weapons or utiility.
This game has many different weapons ranging from sub-machine guns to sniper rifles. Weapons will range on price depending
on how much damage it will cause. The game will continue on until one team reaches 16 round wins or both teams reach 15 rounds won each.</p>
<h3>The CS Series</h3>
<p>Counter-Strike as stated before was started as a mod for a very popular game.
The next version of this game will be known as Counter-Strike 1.6. This game later began the series for the hit game
Counter-Strike. The game was such a hit that they created a new game called Counter-Strike : Source. This game was a more casual version of <thead>
  competitive game. Finally the most popular game they have created is now known as Counter-Strike : Global Offensive, or CS:GO.
This game was the start of a new way to play CS. This game created a new system that allowed you to customize your weapons with
skins created by the steam community. Currently they release a new case about every 3 months to release more skins to the public.
This system increased the population of this game by a lot because it allowed users to open cases for money to give them the thrill
of gambling while gaining cool skins for the weapons in the game. The series started with 2 creaters who created the mod version, their names
being Mihn "Gooseman" Le and Jess "Cliffe" Cliffe. They were later hired by valve (owners of steam) to help create more to the CS franchise.
